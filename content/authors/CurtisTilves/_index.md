Curtis is a molecular epidemiologist interested in the roles that lifestyle, the microbiome, and body composition play in the development and progression of cardiometabolic diseases. Curtis did is undergraduate and graduate training at the University of Pittsburgh, PA, where he received training in analysis of body imaging data and helped to design and implement a fecal microbiome pilot study for the Tobago Health Study cohort (Tobago, Trinidad and Tobago). Curtis is now an NHLBI T32 cardiovascular epidemiology postdoctoral trainee at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, where his current research focuses on the roles of the microbiome and microbially-derived metabolites in obesity and hypertension.
