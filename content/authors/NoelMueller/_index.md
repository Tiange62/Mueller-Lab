My research is primarily dedicated to the prevention of obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertensive disorders and cardiovascular diseases throughout the life course. I approach these research challenges from the perspectives of nutrition, epidemiology and microbiome science. I believe that primordial prevention of lifestyle and environmental risk factors, particularly in high-risk and nutritionally transitioning populations, provides the greatest opportunity to curb contemporary, chronic disease epidemics. My research largely aims to identify early-life, modifiable antecedents of  disease in diverse populations locally and globally. 

Most recently my research has focused on using observational studies to identify early-life impacts on the development of the intestinal microbiota, and leveraging clinical trials to understand how we can restore and/or modify our intestinal microbiota to improve our health. I work in the Department of Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research.
